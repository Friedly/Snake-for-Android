# Snake-for-Android
I was just curious how to develop Games with Android Studio on an Android Smartphone.

Snake Clone
Made by Julien Saevecke

You can control the snake on clicking on the gamescreen.
The Gamescreen has 4 invisible buttons to navigate the snakes so you can
play the game on a smartphone.
One on the left, right and two in the center(top center, bottom center).

To start the game double click on Snake.jar

The graphics are not made by me. Do not credit me for them.
