# Snake-for-Android
I was just curious how to develop Games with Android Studio on an Android Smartphone.

You can control the snake on clicking on the gamescreen.
The Gamescreen has 4 invisible buttons to navigate the snakes so you can
play the game on a smartphone.
One on the left, right and two in the center(top center, bottom center).
